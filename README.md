## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify Web site](https://rj-nft-preview-component.netlify.app/)



## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While developing this component I learned about an interesting CSS property (inset:0;), I used this property to make the container ".overlay-icon" make up all the available space of its parent element. Before I knew about this property I used to set height:100%; and width:100%;

Becuase I just discovered the inset property I'm not sure I can always use it for that purpose, but it worked well for this project.


### Continued development

I keep learning and improving my HTML ans CSS skills

### Useful resources

- [How To Create An Image Hover Effect With CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3RE5CGt9U&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) - This helped to set the CSS styles for the eye icon.
